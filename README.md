## Ideation
> We want to make an app to make walking/ running around in your neighborhood fun. We will do this by creating an app that mixes game-like qualities with achievement tracking features.

## Stakeholders
> We interviewed Emily S., a university student who is a former track and field runner, but now she does soccer and running for fun.

### Desires:
 Emily discussed how she desired the basics of a usual running tracker app for this project. Her main points are:
 - **Map**: To see where she is running/ walking and what route she is on.
 - **Distance Tracking**: To see how much/ far she has ran/ walked.
 - **Pace Tracker**: To see if she needs to slow down/ move faster to avoid overexertion.
 - **Weather Predictions**: To see if the weather is clear enough for the user to run/ walk in.
 - **Air Quality**: To check if the air quality is clear enough for the user to run/ walk outside without damaging their respiratory system.

<ul>
<li> A map for easy navigation and visualization of routes 
<ul> <li>We discussed the possibility of our app being a discovery- type app, where the user runs around the area and it unlocks parts of the map, kind of like a game. </li> </ul>
<li>As the user runs around more, the map clears up. 
<li>Distance tracking 
<li> Pace, telling user to run faster/ slower
<li> Accurate weather predictions
<li>Air quality data

### Frustrations:
Emily also shared some frustrations she had with normal running/ walking tracking apps. Here are some of her frustrations below:
- **Incorrect Time Data**: Emily said that she always forgets to stop her stopwatch, so her time data isn’t always accurate.
- **No Pattern Summary**: Emily would like to see her main trends summarized, her current tracking app that she uses does not summarize her weekly progress.
- **No Fun Routes to Run**: Taking the same running routes over and over can be a bit monotonous, Emily introduced the possibility of our app being able to show her new running routes that show her landmarks around her area.
- **No Improvement Keeper**: Emily would like to see the goals and achievements she has made over the years (like comparing her 2023 self to her 2024 self).

    <li> Emily said that she always forgets to stop her stopwatch, so her time data isn’t always accurate. </li>
    <li> Maybe an automatic clock stopper that checks pace, when user stops walking/ running clock pauses/ stops. </li>

    <li> Emily would like to see her main trends summarized, maybe we could do a weekly summary. </li>
    </ul>
<li> Don’t know places to run: Exploration (routes, sightseeing, places safe to run) </li>
<ul>
    <li> Something like in Pokemon GO, where there’s points for landmarks and routes for users to walk on. </li>
    <li> Maybe users can create and save their own routes.
    </ul>
<li> Improvement keeper </li>
<ul>
    <li> See what goals/ achievements Emily has made over the years (ex: comparing her 2023 running with her 2024 running). </li>
    <li> Maybe have a function that sets goals and can be completed. </li>

## Product Vision Statement

> To motivate and track your running process through a game-ified running tracking app, helping you explore your neighborhood and to make it more fun.

## User Requirements

### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to view a map of my location so I can explore different routes while walking.
2. As a user, I want to view statistics about my activities so I can track how often/how much I've walked.
3. As a user, I want a one tap start button for my runs so I can begin tracking in the background quickly.
4. As a user, I want the app to suggest new running routes based on my past activity and friends’ activity so I can explore different areas and maybe see friends currently running.
5. As a user, I want to set weekly goals and personalized achievements so I can stay motivated and track my progress.
6. As a user, I want to keep my running pace so that I will not overexert myself.
7. As a user, I want to keep an accurate log of my run time so I can see how much time I have dedicated to running/ exercising.
8. As a user, I want to know the air quality of my area before I run so that I know if I should run inside or outside today.
9. As a user, I want my running to be more interesting and interactive so I can be more immersed in my exercise.
10. As a user, I want to motivation stay consistent so I can continue improving my running skills and strength.
