## Stakeholders
We interviewed Emily S., a university student who is a former track and field runner, but now she does soccer and running for fun.

Desires:
- A map for easy navigation and visualization of routes
-   We discussed the possibility of our app being a discovery- type app, where the user runs around the area and it unlocks parts of the map, kind of like a game.
-   As the user runs around more, the map clears up.
- Distance tracking
- Pace, telling user to run faster/ slower
- Accurate weather predictions
- Air quality data

Frustrations:
- Time tracker
    - Emily said that she always forgets to stop her stopwatch, so her time data isn’t always accurate.
    - Maybe an automatic clock stopper that checks pace, when user stops walking/ running clock pauses/ stops.
- No pattern summary
    - Emily would like to see her main trends summarized, maybe we could do a weekly summary.
- Don’t know places to run: Exploration (routes, sightseeing, places safe to run) 
    - Something like in Pokemon GO, where there’s points for landmarks and routes for users to walk on.
    - Maybe users can create and save their own routes.
- Improvement keeper
    - See what goals/ achievements Emily has made over the years (ex: comparing her 2023 running with her 2024 running).
    - Maybe have a function that sets goals and can be completed.


## Product Vision Statement

To motivate and track your running process through a game-ified running tracking app, helping you explore your neighborhood and to make it more fun.

## User Requirements

### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to view a map of my location so I can explore different routes while walking.
2. As a user, I want to view statistics about my activities so I can track how often/how much I've walked.
3. As a user, I want a one tap start button for my runs so I can begin tracking in the background quickly.
4. As a user, I want the app to suggest new running routes based on my past activity and friends’ activity so I can explore different areas and maybe see friends currently running.
5. As a user, I want to set weekly goals and personalized achievements so I can stay motivated and track my progress.
6. As a user, I want to keep my running pace so that I will not overexert myself.
7. As a user, I want to keep an accurate log of my run time so I can see how much time I have dedicated to running/ exercising.
8. As a user, I want to know the air quality of my area before I run so that I know if I should run inside or outside today.
9. As a user, I want my running to be more interesting and interactive so I can be more immersed in my exercise
10. As a user, I want to motivation stay consistent so I can continue improving my running skills and strength
