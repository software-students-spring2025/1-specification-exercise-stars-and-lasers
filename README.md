## Stakeholders
We interviewed Emily S., a university student who is a fomer track and field runner, but now she does soccer and running for fun.

Desires:
- Map
- We discussed the possibility of our app being a discovery- type app, where the user runs around the area and it unlocks parts of the map, kind of like a game
- As the user runs around more, the map clears up
- Distance tracking
- Pace, telling user to run faster/ slower
- Accurate weather predictions
- Air quality data

Frustrations:
- Time tracker
    - Emily said that she always forgets to stop her stopwatch, so her time data isn’t always accurate
    - Maybe automatic clock stopper that checks pace, when user stops walking/ running clock pauses/ stops
- No pattern summary
    - Emily would like to see her main trends summarized, maybe we could do a weekly summary
- Don’t know places to run: Exploration (routes, sightseeing, places safe to run) 
    - For this one I’m thinking of something maybe like in Pokemon GO, where there’s points for landmarks & routes for users to walk on
    - Maybe users can create & save their own routes
- Improvement keeper
    - See what goals/ achievements Emily has made over the years (ex: comparing her 2023 running with her 2024 running)
    - Maybe we could have a function that sets goals and can be completed


## Product Vision Statement

To motivate and track your running process through a game-ified running tracking app, helping you explore your neighborhood and to make it more fun.

## User Requirements

See instructions. Delete this line and place a list of your User Stories here.

### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to view a map of my location so I can explore different routes while walking.
2. As a user, I want to view statistics about my activities so I can track how often/how much I've walked.

## Activity Diagrams

### Activity Diagram for Managing Goals

* User Story: As a user, I want to set weekly goals and personalized achievements so I can stay motivated and track my progress.

### Activity Diagram for Viewing Current Route

* User Story: As a user, I want my running to be more interactive so I can be more immersed in my exercise.

### Site Map

## Wireframe Diagrams

Create a set of wireframe diagrams representing every screen of the application. Wireframes are black-and-white diagrams that show the general layout of the screen, and the content that appears on each screen, but not the actual colors, images, fonts, or other visual design elements that will be used in the final product.

## Clickable Prototype

See instructions. Delete this line and place a publicly-accessible link to your clickable prototype here.

Convert the wireframe diagrams into a clickable prototype. These should be complete: every link or button in the prototype should take the user to the next screen in the flow; every place where actual content will go on each screen (i.e. every bit of text, image, or video) should be represented in the wireframe diagrams used in the clickable prototype. Use as little real-looking text as possible to make it obvious what will be written in the text blocks of the final product, while not showing so much that it distracts from the abstract purpose of the wireframe diagrams.

By using the clickable prototype, a non-technical person who is not closely involved with the project should be able to understand what the application is and how it works. Nothing should be left to the imagination.

Place a link to the published clickable prototype in the `README.md` file in the appropriate place. The link must not require a user to log in to view the prototype.
